# PRODIGY_CS_02
# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This project includes a password strength checker implemented both as a web application and as a terminal-based application. The goal is to provide a visual representation of the strength of a password in the web app and a terminal-based checker for quick password strength feedback.

## Features

- **Web Application:**
  - Password Strength Meter: Visual feedback on password strength with color-coded indicators.
  - Responsive Design: The interface adjusts to fit different screen sizes.

- **Terminal Application:**
  - Simple command-line interface to check password strength.
  - Text-based feedback on password strength.
  - Additional validation for password length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

## Project Structure

- **Web Application:**
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the login form and password strength meter.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript file that handles password strength calculation and updates the strength meter.
  - `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the login form and the strength meter.
  - `pr.jpg`: Image file used in the project.

- **Terminal Applications:**
  - `password_checker.py`: Python script that checks the strength of a password entered in the terminal.
  - `assess_password_strength.py`: Enhanced Python script that includes additional validation for password strength.
